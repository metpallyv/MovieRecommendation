# MovieRecommendation using Regularized Matrix factorization
The goal of this project is to build a movie recommendation system using Non negative regularized matrix factorization without using any Machine Learning libraries on movie lens dataset

1. In a recommendation system such as Netflix or MovieLens, there is a group of users and a set of items (movies for the above two systems). Given that each users have rated some items in the system, we would like to predict how the users would rate the items that they have not yet rated, such that we can make recommendations to the users. 

2. Recommendations can be generated by a wide range of algorithms. While user-based or item-based collaborative filtering methods are simple and intuitive, matrix factorization techniques are usually more effective because they allow us to discover the latent features underlying the interactions between users and items. Regularized Matrix factorization avoids overfitting.
Refer these slides to understand better : http://www.slideshare.net/BenjaminBengfort/non-negative-matrix-factorization

3. I implmented Regularized Matrix factorization based on the following :
      
      1. Movie Lens dataset, describes 5-star rating. It contains 21,000,000 ratings and 510,000 tag applications applied to 30,000 movies by 230,000 users.
      2. Ratings.csv file is the rating file. Each line of this file after the header row represents one rating of one movie by          one user, and has the following format:  userId,movieId,rating,timestamp
      3. Movie information is contained in the file movies.csv. Each line of this file after the header row represents one               movie, and has the following format:     movieId,title,genres

4. MatrixFactorization.py codes implementes the regularized matrix factorization model(Gradient Descent) without using any Machine Learning libraries and saves it as a file, which can then used to perform recommendation. I used the below parameter values:

      1.  steps : the maximum number of steps to perform the optimisation was set to 5000
      2.  alpha : the learning rate was set to 0.0002
      3.  beta  : the regularization parameter was set to 0.02
      4.  k     : hidden latent features was set to 8

5. Recommend.py takes in users as a input and recommends top 25 movies out of his/her unrated movies if the predicted rating for these movies is greater than 3.5 as ideally we want to recommend only good movies

6. Results for users 1 to 5 as follows:

7. Results seem to be good but the model takes ~7 hours to run on full movielens data set of 21,000,000 ratings and 510,000 tag applications applied to 30,000 movies by 230,000 users. Hence, I will implement a ApacheSpark version and run it on hdfs to optimize the performance

8. Boom! I implemented Apache Spark version of this project using Spark ALS MLlib library. I took like ~30 minutes to run the entire recommendation on HDFS. Wow! what a performance improvement. Refer this project for Apache Spark implementation:
